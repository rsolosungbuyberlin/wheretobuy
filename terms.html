THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND MATERIALS</strong><br><br>7.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Third Party Materials in the Services</span>. Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (“<strong>Third Party Materials</strong>”) or provide links to certain third party websites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral Program.</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When a Referrer refers a new customer to NaturalRSO membership products, that new customer receives a referral code to use at checkout for membership products. If that new customer places a purchase, the Referrer receives the same discount on his or her next subscription order. Only one discount will be applied per subscription order, so if a Referrer refers 5 new customers, his or her subscription orders will be discounted for the next 5 renewals. No more than one discount can be applied to one referral or Referrer’s order. If you participate in this program, we may collect and use personal information to offer you financial incentives, or price or service differences, such as discounts, benefits, or other unique rewards for the disclosure of such personal information (e.g., refer-a-friend program, email marketing, and text message registration). If you consent to participate in these offerings, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details set forth herein.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCPA | Pursuant to certain data protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, you may be entitled to be informed as to why our financial incentives, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of the personal information that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal information. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to any personal information we collect. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of our financial incentives, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal information collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or financial incentive provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal information collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the transferability of such personal information, (iii) the discounted price offered, (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our marketing programs, and (v) the product or service to which the financial incentive, or price or service difference, applies. The disclosure of the value and calculation described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DISCOUNT CODES | From time to time, we may offer qualified consumers “discount codes”, “promotional codes”, “promo codes”, or “offer codes” through a variety of promotional activities and communications (collectively referred to herein as “offer codes”) that are redeemable towards a purchase on the Services, subject to any conditions, exclusions or restrictions specified by us in the terms for that offer. Only valid offer codes provided or promoted by NaturalRSO will be honored at checkout. Codes supplied or promoted by third-parties unauthorized by us (including any unauthorized third-party websites) will not be considered valid. Each offer code provided by us is non-transferable and valid for single use on an item (or items) of merchandise as determined by us. Offer codes cannot be applied to previously placed orders. Offer codes may not be combined and customers are limited to the use of a single offer code per order. For online purchases, the code must be entered in the ‘offer code’ field prior to checkout. We are not responsible for lost, stolen or corrupted codes or any unauthorized use of codes. Offer codes cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent; no substitutions or credits allowed. The dollar value of any offer code will not be refunded or credited back if any or all of the merchandise is returned. Expiry dates may apply to each offer code. Offer codes are void if copied, transferred, sold, exchanged or expired, and where prohibited. Requests not complying with all offer code requirements will not be honored.</span></li>

Your access to and use of the Services are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an “<strong>AS IS</strong>” and “<strong>AS AVAILABLE</strong>” basis, without any warranty of any kind. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, NaturalRSO, its parents, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners and licensors (the “<strong>NaturalRSO Entities</strong>”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The NaturalRSO Entities make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (a) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services; (b) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services; (c) the operation or compatibility with any other application or any particular system or device; (d) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure or error-free basis; and (e) the deletion of, or the failure to store or transmit, Your Content and other communications maintained by the Services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the NaturalRSO Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.<br><br>8.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NaturalRSO Product.</span>&nbsp;</span>As with any probiotic, minor adverse effects such as gas, change in bowel patterns, bloating, and GI disturbance may occur. These side effects are typical, and the body usually acclimates after a few days up to 1 week of probiotic use. No allergic reactions were observed within the clinical trial, and NaturalRSO Glucose Control is free from common allergens such as nuts, dairy, and gluten.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><strong id="nine">9. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY<br></strong><br>9.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of Liability</span>. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL THE PENDULUM ENTITIES BE LIABLE (A) FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES), HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF THE PENDULUM ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, OR (B) FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE DELIVERY, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE PENDULUM ENTITIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES FINALLY AWARDED SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00), OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID THE PENDULUM ENTITIES, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX (6) MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES (OR PRODUCTS PURCHASED ON THE SERVICES) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. <br><br><strong id="ten">10. INDEMNIFICATION</strong><br><br>10.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indemnification</span>. By entering into these Terms and using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold the NaturalRSO Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms, the Purchase Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) any unauthorized use of the Services; (d) Your Content, or (e) your negligence or willful misconduct.<br><br><strong id="eleven">11. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br></strong><br>11.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Informal Process First</span>. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and the NaturalRSO Entities relating in any way to these Terms or your use of the Services, you will first contact NaturalRSO and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action.<br><br>11.2.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</span>. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “<strong>Claim</strong>”) relating in any way to your use of the Services, will be resolved by arbitration. You and the NaturalRSO agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). <strong>Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and NaturalRSO are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration</strong>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and NaturalRSO will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative and non-class basis. An arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. <br><br>11.3.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs of Arbitration</span>. Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the JAMS Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, NaturalRSO will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. <br><br>11.4.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt-Out</span>. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to <a href="contact.html" target="_blank"><em>our contact page</em></a> or to the U.S. mailing address listed at the bottom of this Agreement. The notice must be sent to NaturalRSO within 30 days of your registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, NaturalRSO also will not be bound by them.<br><br><strong id="twelve">12. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS<br></strong><br>12.1.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMS Messaging and Phone Calls</span>. Certain portions of the Services may allow us to contact you via telephone or text messages. You agree that NaturalRSO may contact you via telephone or text messages (including by an automatic telephone dialing system) at any of the phone numbers provided by you or on your behalf in connection with your use of the Services, including for customer service purposes. You understand that you are not required to provide this consent as a condition of purchasing any products. You also understand that you may opt out of receiving text messages from us at any time, either by texting the word “<strong>STOP</strong>” to [PENDULUM TO ADD #] using the mobile device that is receiving the messages, or by logging into our Account and updating your preferences. If you do not choose to opt out, we may contact you as outlined in our Privacy Policy.<br><br>12.2.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updating These Terms</span>. We may revise these Terms from time to time in which case we will update the “<strong>Last Revised</strong>” date at the top of these Terms, with such new Terms taking effect on the date of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms. If we make changes that are material, we will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you, such as by e-mail and/or by placing a prominent notice on the first page of the NaturalRSO website. You should review these Terms every time you use the Site because they are binding on you. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HERE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE</strong>. Your continued access or use of the Services following the posting of any changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. Your use of any other Services, as well as your accessing or ordering of any investigational and/or commercial products from any Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions. In the event of any inconsistency between such additional terms and conditions and these general Terms, these Terms shall govern.<br><br>12.3.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination of License and Your Account</span>. If you breach any of the terms of these Terms, all licenses granted by NaturalRSO will terminate automatically. Additionally, NaturalRSO may suspend, disable, or delete your Account and/or the Services (or any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any or no reason. If NaturalRSO deletes your Account for any suspected breach of these Terms by you, you are prohibited from re-registering for the Services under a different name. In the event of Account deletion for any reason, NaturalRSO may, but is not obligated to, delete any of Your Content. NaturalRSO shall not be responsible for the failure to delete or deletion of Your Content. All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by NaturalRSO or you. Termination will not limit any of NaturalRSO’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. <br><br>
        12.4.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injunctive Relief</span>. You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to NaturalRSO for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and NaturalRSO shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.<br><br>
        12.5.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">California Residents</span>. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at <a href="tel:8009525210" target="_blank">(800) 952-5210</a>.<br><br>12.6.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Severability</span>. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<br><br>
        12.7.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous</span>. These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by NaturalRSO but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of NaturalRSO. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The Services are operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all arbitration and other litigation of any dispute between you and NaturalRSO related to these Terms shall be located in San Francisco, California. <br><br>
